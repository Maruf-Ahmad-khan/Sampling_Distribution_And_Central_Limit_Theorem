Sampling Distribution it is a kind of representation in probability distribution of mean ,
std and variance where we calculate multiple samples that is drawn from the same population,
it is used in statical analysis and hypothesis testing

Central limit theorem(CLT) 
The central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample means of a large number of independent
and identically distributed random variable approach will approach a normal distribution ,
regardless of the underlying distribution of the variables. The condition required for the CLT(Central limit theorem) to hold are

The sample size is large enough , typically greater than equal to 30.
The sample is drawn from a finite population or an infinite population with a finite variance.
The random variables in the sample are independent and identically distributed.
Note:=> CLT is important in statistics and Machine learning we can use CLT to construct confidence intervals, 
perform hypothesis tests, and make prediction about the population mean based on the sample data,
CLT provides a theoretical Justification such as T-Test, ANOVA and Linear Regression.

In this workbook I have imported the titenic dataset and performed all these statical calculation on "PassengerId" column
